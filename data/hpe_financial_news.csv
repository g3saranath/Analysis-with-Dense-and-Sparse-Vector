"The stock market should be great, not on a knife's edge. But that's the opportunity",8/11/2024,"When I look at Thursday's rally, I am beginning to realize that we have become so binary and so up close that we have lost our ability to think about what matters. The big fish data got caught among the minnow minutiae and we ended up with ridiculous rallies that are, therefore, based on nothing. That, of course, tells you that those newfound percentages can be taken away based on nothing. That's how trapped and intellectually devoid we have become. I have now studied every aspect of the runup of that beautiful â€” for the bulls â€” session on Thursday, and I can truly say that it was game-set-match in favor of the bulls by 8:30 a.m. ET â€” one hour before regular stock trading begins. That's when the weekly jobless claims number was released. The components of that print â€” somehow â€” made sidelined investors feel more comfortable that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates without the economy rolling over, so it's all clear to buy. They tackled the opening at 9:30 a.m. ET hard, with the industrials and techs getting the benefit of the doubt. Was it an S & P futures-based program that resurrected stocks, both in the morning and at the close? It got hard to tell. It was that positive a session. How could a number that comes out every Thursday really play the catalyst? The absurdity of it is palpable. I mean you could hire 10,000 actors and then lay them off and you might have had a selloff of gigantic proportions because the hard-landing types would be unfettered. Then again, is that any more outrageous behavior than watching unknown large institutions sell their large-cap U.S. stocks on Monday because Japan's central bank raised rates there, causing an over 12% decline in Japanese stocks in one session? The lunacy of that move and its aftershocks brought Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX , to a 52-week high of 65.73 intraday, another insane collaterally thoughtless metric that alternately scared some and made others feel the whole thing is overdone. At the same time, the S & P 500 held at certain levels that helped start the fire. For comparison, the VIX was at a 52-week low of 10.62 on July 19. The whole thing was chimerical. Let's step back for a moment and remember where we are: We've been in a precarious earnings season and the havoc dealt to whole sectors screams to be noticed. Whole swaths of positive points were rolled back because of the Japanese-related craziness. For example, this season started with the banks roaring higher on great numbers, legitimately great numbers led by a phenomenal Bank of America quarter. Then less than a month later, we get the unleashed tsunami of selling that seemed particularly harsh on the financials. On top of that came the report of huge selling of Bank of America stock by Warren Buffett as if, somehow, that meant he no longer liked the banks as a group. Nobody questioned whether Buffett was just selling everything not nailed down, including Club holding Apple . Or maybe there's been some passing of the baton and the new manager wants a clean slate. Somehow, though, Buffett doomed the financials in part because he was caught selling the best one. Looking back, of course, the journalistic imperative is to find a reason for that Japanese yen carry trade hangover to legitimize the selling. We can't just say that a bunch of overleveraged cowboys who thought they were immune from mistakes blew out their winning banking positions turning them into losses. Then some old Buffett sell program for who knows what reason came on top of it. We can't say that because it makes us sound stupid. So, we decide that the banks stocks are going down because they historically do badly when the Fed starts cutting rates. We let the story get in the way of the facts. Rate cuts are very bullish for banks. The possibility of credit losses will be stayed. The net interest income (NII) holy grail may give way to loan growth and, in some cases, better expense numbers because off artificial intelligence. We are now well on our way to improving urban areas as recognized by the strength of commercial developers SL Green and Boston Properties. The office building cataclysm seems now behind us. As the yen carry trade was being unwound, we had a whole series of tech companies report earnings. Even as we had a cellphone resurgence, even as we have a personal computer refresh â€” otherwise hallmark events â€” all that mattered was excess data center spend and the rumor that Nvidia 's Blackwell chip platform was being delayed indefinitely. Nvidia is, and has always been, an honest company. The rumor couldn't be squelched because Nvidia is in a quiet period ahead of earnings out on Aug. 28. The stock took a beating. Enter 0DTE options â€” or zero days to expirations options. We're talking about those DraftKings-like instruments that only served to verify the distinctly negative action. I found it hard to believe that we saw obits of Nvidia all week, including stories that said the eyepopping gains made no sense after all. Did anyone stop to think that it is still the number one performer in the S & P 500, having dethroned Super Micro Computer ? Did anyone bother to read or hear what dethroned Super Micro; the fact that it was overwhelmed with orders and couldn't fulfill them? Did anyone bother to check that Club name Meta Platforms apparently placed an order so large that Super Micro misjudged or perhaps overpromised? Was anyone factoring in that one of the great data center companies, Arista Networks , reported a phenomenal set of numbers, signifying that all is well with the buildout? No. The market gods simply pronounced the data story dead, which then reverberated as far as Club industrials Eaton and the even more tangential Dover , was a real decimation that washed over anything good in the semi world. It also took with it a couple of fallen stars, Micron, Dell , Hewlett Packard Enterprise , and Club name Advanced Micro Devices . The later just made no sense because it is pulling away from Intel on the low end and if Nvidia really does have production problems then AMD is the de facto winner. Again, Nvidia gets the blame. In fact, the only stock that didn't suffer from an Nvidia relation, Apple, got through earnings without too much trouble. But it then got eviscerated by Buffett, by the way, said he didn't want to sell Apple when apparently he was selling it at roughly the same time. Maybe that was what shocked people into dumping the stock. It's pretty ironic but the Magnificent Six stocks â€” we own them all â€” got pressured by all of this even as the market judged all of the quarters of decent quality except Amazon , which was considered to be an out and out disaster. That made it my favorite one because the story was complicated by minute-to-minute declines in ordering things during major news events including the attempted assassination Donald Trump and the Olympics. Until this quarter, no one thought much of any distraction and weaker sales. We didn't realize how little was made on smaller same-day packages. We totally ignored the unbelievable Amazon Web Services cloud performance, something that was so strong, with giant gross margins, that should have counteracted Amazon Prime weakness on the retail side. I liked the quarter. For those by-and-large excellent quarters we ended up have declines of monumental proportions that almost seem like they are preordained and the beginning of a new bear market. Not only that, we've turned on AI with a vengeance. It now feels like nothing can be gained from it. Some of that thesis is bogus. We just don't really find out how AI is working because many AI customers don't want to dissemble about what's really happening behind the scenes: consultants like Accenture , Deloitte, McKinsey, and E & Y advising execs to hold off on hiring because workers seem to be twice as productive with their AI tools. So, why not get rid of half the people in your organization? Do you really need that many? Who knows? When I meet with executives who are using AI, they are telling me that they aren't sure how many people they need â€” except it's less than before? No one want to talk about it like that. There is heightened sensitivity to firing people right now, more than expected. So, the pro-AI story line goes unwanted save ServiceNow and maybe the now-disappointing Club name, Salesforce . I can't believe how few executives realize that if they don't start saying how they use AI we are going to start penalizing them, too. I've been saying those two companies have regarded AI as a mainstay of their business. I was hoping to find others. I didn't. Where does this leave us? I think in a place where we are moderately oversold where many just expect a decline or a retest starting this week. I know we are looking for one and want to put the money we took out of the market to build up newer positions that are too small to matter. It's a topic I will talk about at this week's Monthly Meeting livestream for Club members. Lost in the shuffle â€” other than Apple, which historically traded with a lower multiple â€” things are cheap. Even Apple, if you regard the service stream as newly paramount, can't be regarded as overwhelmingly expensive. We are getting a chance for the industrials and the aerospace and defense stocks to shine. Everything else seems to be running in place even as we are headed into Fed rate cut world. To recap, despite good fundamentals, despite Fed rate cut(s) coming, despite an increasing likelihood of a soft economic landing, despite the fact that a wall of money might come in from the sidelines because of lower rates, we really do trade miserably. That's unless we get a positive data point of the day as we did last Thursday. It causes us to wonder what we are missing. Is it Vice President Kamala Harris ' seeming wish if she were to become president to raise corporate taxes from favorable moment to one that creates the need for immediate estimate cuts? Is it the prospect of a mercurial Trump if he were to regain the White House who threatens cherished Federal Reserve independence? Right now, we don't know and that makes things all the more fragile, especially because well-known market bears have been trotted out and put on TV regaling us with their prowess even as they have made no money in ages. At least they are not Cathie Wood where you get to see how truly bad she is in terms of picking stocks. Her endless buys at one foolish level are only matched by her endless sells well below that level. We're not sanguine even as I sense we should be, given how tame rates have gotten and how good earnings are. Sure, we are about to get a raft of earnings but only retail seems problematic. No matter, I think there will be buyers galore of Home Depot and Lowe's on some sort of last-bad-quarter thesis. That's one of reasons I am expecting some positive action from our housing related stories. It's what the textbooks tell you to buy at this juncture. Ultimately, though, it's my faith in the data center â€” buttressed by a belief that Nvidia's roadmap can change things for the stocks of so many companies, including the ones trashed in the last three week â€” as well as my belief that a beckoning rate cut cycle is inherently good news for the market. It should be a good moment, but it isn't. Hmm? Therein lies the opportunity. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

HPE-Juniper Networks $14B Merger: EU To Make Key Decisions By August,11/8/2024,"HPE-Juniper Networks $14B Merger: EU To Make Key Decisions By August
By Mark Haranas
July 8, 2024, 12:08 PM EDT
HPE has filed with the European regulatory commissions for approval to purchase Juniper Networks. Here’s the timeline for the blockbuster $14 billion merger.



Listen to this article
4 min
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has filed with the European Commission for regulatory approval of its blockbuster $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks. European regulators now have until August to either approve HPE’s deal or force deeper investigations that could potentially stall the merger.

The European Commission now has a deadline of Aug. 1 to either approve the HPE-Juniper merger or open a full-scale investigation into the deal.

Additionally, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) recently started a preliminary investigation into the potential impacts of the massive tech merger.

The CMA has set a deadline of Aug. 14 to decide whether to approve the deal or progress the investigation to a formal “phase 2” inquiry that would spawn a deeper investigation.

[Related: The 10 Hottest Cloud Computing Startups Of 2024 (So Far)]

“The CMA is considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002,” said U.K. Competition and Markets Authority in a statement. “And, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.”

This all means HPE’s $14 billion deal for Juniper Networks could potentially receive the green light in Europe by mid-August.

When Will The HPE-Juniper Acquisition Officially Close?

The merger has been approved by both HPE and Juniper board of directors as well as shareholders.

Importantly, it is unlikely that the deal will need China’s approval as it falls below the Chinese merger threshold. But the U.S. Federal Trade Commission will still likely scrutinize the merger.

Regardless of all the regulatory hurdles, HPE says it expects to acquire Juniper Networks in late 2024 or early 2025.

“We can confirm the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority has accepted our filing, as part of the standard process to review the proposed acquisition of Juniper Networks in several jurisdictions,” said HPE in a statement to CRN. “We are working to complete all necessary reviews and secure clearance quickly and efficiently so that we can begin delivering value to our customers as soon as possible. We continue to expect to close by the end of calendar year 2024 or early 2025.”

This still fits within HPE’s initial timeframe of closing the deal by as late as early 2025, roughly one year after announcing the deal.

HPE’s $14 Billion Plan For Juniper

In January, HPE unveiled its plan to buy networking superstar Juniper Networks for $14 billion.

The merger is expected to achieve joint operating efficiencies and cost synergies of $450 million per year.

The combination of the two tech giants could establish a new battleground in the networking space as well as in AI. Juniper Networks CEO Rami Rahim, if the deal is completed, will lead the combined HPE networking business, which includes HPE’s Aruba business. Rahim will report directly to HPE CEO Antonio Neri.

In a recent interview with CRN, Rahim said AI is going “to be as big, if not bigger” than any technology trend in history.

“The kind of moves that are necessary to capture this [AI] opportunity are the big bold moves,” he said.

“This combination with HPE is exactly that. It gives us an ability to accelerate our innovation across the entire networking stack. In fact, not even the networking stack, but the entire IT stack, compute, storage, networking, silicon systems and software, in all of the relevant networking domains for our customers; campus, branch, data center, wide area networks, and to all of the different customer verticals, certainly enterprise, but also cloud and service providers, as well,” Rahim told CRN. “Together with HPE, we can build truly comprehensive, competitive, end-to-end experience-first networking solutions that are going to make a big difference for our customers and our partners.”",https://www.crn.com/news/networking/2024/hpe-juniper-14b-merger-eu-to-make-key-decisions-by-august

Key Takeaways
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported fiscal third-quarter sales that beat analysts' expectations, buoyed by a surge in server revenue driven by artificial intelligence demand.

Diluted earnings per share missed estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, though adjusted earnings came ahead of projections.

The company raised and narrowed its outlook for full-year earnings.





Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) posted fiscal third-quarter sales that beat analysts' expectations, buoyed by a surge in server revenue driven by demand for artificial intelligence (AI).

The server and storage maker reported third-quarter revenue jumped 10% year-over-year to $7.7 billion, above analysts’ expectations. Server revenue was up 35% from the year-ago quarter to $4.3 billion. Revenue from HP Enterprise's Intelligent Edge and cloud segments fell year-over-year, while revenue in its financial services segment rose 1%.

Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 38 cents missed analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, though adjusted EPS of 50 cents came ahead of projections.

“These results reflect our momentum in delivering on our edge-to-cloud strategy across networking, hybrid cloud, and AI,"" HP Enterprise CEO Antonio Neri said in a release.

The company raised its full-year EPS outlook to between $1.68 and $1.73, up from $1.61 to $1.71 previously, and maintained its revenue growth estimate of 1% to 3%.

HP Enterprise shares were down about 1.9% at $18.42 in extended trading Wednesday following the company's earnings release.

-1.52%
(Bloomberg) -- Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. reported weaker-than-expected margins, suggesting lower profitability than anticipated in its closely watched business of selling servers for artificial intelligence work.

Fiscal third-quarter adjusted gross margins were 31.8%, a decline from the period a year ago, the company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated 33.4%. The decline was driven by a “higher mix of AI server revenue,” Chief Financial Officer Marie Myers said on a call with analysts after the results were released.

Hardware makers including HPE, Dell Technologies Inc. and Super Micro Computer Inc. have enjoyed a jump in customer demand for high-powered servers to handle AI tasks. HPE reported $1.3 billion in revenue from this business line in the quarter that ended July 31, a 39% increase from the previous period and higher than analysts’ average estimate.

Investors have become increasingly concerned about the lower margins of most AI servers, owing to the expensive semiconductors they contain made by companies such as Nvidia Corp. In an interview, Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri said that over time HPE will sell more higher-margin products and services along with the AI servers.

The shares declined about 3% in extended trading after closing at $18.77 in New York. The stock has gained 11% this year through the close.

“Weak AI-server margin has been a theme for the sector, tripping up Super Micro and Dell over the past couple of quarters,” Woo Jin Ho, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a note. HPE’s soft margins “may overshadow its healthy AI sales momentum,” he added.


The majority of HPE’s AI server business continues to come from cloud service providers, but there is increasing momentum with enterprises and governments, Neri said.

HPE reported that total revenue increased 10% to $7.71 billion in the period, compared with the $7.66 billion average estimate. It’s the biggest year-over-year sales increase in six quarters. Profit, excluding some items, was 50 cents a share. Analysts, on average, projected 47 cents.

In the quarter ending in October, HPE projected sales of $8.1 billion to $8.4 billion. Profit, excluding some items, will be 52 cents a share to 57 cents a share. Analysts, on average, estimated profit of 54 cents on revenue of $8.15 billion.

HPE said it received about $2.1 billion from the partial sale of its stake in H3C Technologies Co. The financial impact of that transaction will be reflected in the current quarter’s results, the company said.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with HPE.


On February 29, 2024, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) released its 8-K filing, detailing the financial outcomes for the first quarter ended January 31, 2024. HPE, a global edge-to-cloud company, reported a mixed financial performance, with a notable decline in revenue but an increase in profitability and annualized revenue run-rate (ARR).

HPE's revenue for the quarter stood at $6.8 billion, reflecting a 14% decrease from the same period last year. This decline was consistent in both actual dollars and constant currency. However, the company's ARR experienced a robust 42% year-over-year growth, reaching $1.4 billion. This growth in ARR underscores HPE's successful strategic pivot towards a recurring revenue model, which is increasingly important in the technology sector where predictable and stable revenue streams are highly valued.

The company's gross margins improved significantly, with GAAP gross profit margin increasing by 240 basis points to 36.4% compared to the prior-year period. This improvement in profitability is indicative of HPE's operational efficiency and its ability to manage costs effectively, even in a challenging market environment.

Despite the revenue decline, HPE's diluted net earnings per share (EPS) on a GAAP basis was $0.29, a 24% decrease from the prior-year period but still above the midpoint of the guidance range. This performance suggests that while top-line growth was pressured, bottom-line results benefited from the company's focus on profitability.

Free cash flow (FCF) for the quarter was negative at $(482) million, yet it showed an improvement of $844 million from the prior-year period. The negative FCF highlights the investment phase of the company's transformation, but the year-over-year improvement signals progress towards generating positive cash flows in the future.

Fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter Outlook

HPE estimates revenue to be in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.4 billion. HPE estimates GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.81 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS(1) to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.57. Fiscal 2024 fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted net EPS excludes net after-tax gain of approximately $0.24 per diluted share primarily related to H3C income, and adjustments related to the sale of H3C, offset by acquisition, disposition and other related charges, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and transformation costs.

Fiscal 2024 Outlook

HPE estimates fiscal 2024 revenue growth of 1% to 3%, in constant currency(1)(5), and fiscal 2024 GAAP operating profit growth to be in the range of 2% to 6% and non-GAAP operating profit(1)(4) growth to be flat to 2%. HPE estimates GAAP diluted net EPS to be in the range of $1.68 and $1.73 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS(1) to be in the range of $1.92 and $1.97. Fiscal 2024 non-GAAP diluted net EPS estimates exclude net after-tax adjustments of approximately $0.24 per diluted share, primarily related to stock-based compensation expense, acquisition, disposition and other related charges, amortization of intangible assets, and transformation costs, offset by H3C income, and adjustments related to the sale of H3C. HPE estimates free cash flow(1)(3)(5) of $1.9 billion.

H3C Technologies Co., Limited Update

HPE also notes that on September 4, 2024, the company received proceeds of approximately $2.1 billion from the partial sale of its equity position in H3C Technologies Co., Limited (representing 30% of all H3C shares) from Unisplendour International Technology Limited. The financial impact of this transaction will be reflected in HPE’s Q4 FY24 and full year FY24 earnings announcement later this year.

1 A description of HPE’s use of non-GAAP financial information is provided below under “Use of non-GAAP financial information and key performance metrics.”

2 Annualized Revenue Run-Rate (“ARR”) is a financial metric used to assess the growth of the Consumption Services offerings. ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income from finance leases), and software-as-a-Service, software consumption revenue, and other as-a-Service offerings, recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. We use ARR as a performance metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with it.

3 Free cash flow represents cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures (investments in property, plant & equipment (“PP&E”) and software assets less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.?

4 FY24 non-GAAP operating profit excludes costs of approximately $1.0 billion primarily related to stock-based compensation expense, acquisition, disposition and other related charges, amortization of intangible assets, and transformation costs, offset by H3C income, and adjustments related to the sale of H3C.

5 Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides certain guidance on a non-GAAP basis. In reliance on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is unable to provide a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts, as the Company cannot predict some elements that are included in such directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These elements could have a material impact on the Company’s reported GAAP results for the guidance period. Refer to the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures below for more information.

Use of non-GAAP financial information and key performance metrics

To supplement Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented on a generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) basis, Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides financial measures, including revenue on a constant currency basis (including at the business segment level), non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit (non-GAAP earnings from operations), non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue), non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow (“FCF”). Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of revenue growth on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, non-GAAP operating profit growth, and FCF. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures for this quarter and prior periods are included in the tables below or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release. In addition an explanation of the ways in which Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its business, the substance behind Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s decision to use these non-GAAP measures, the material limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures, the manner in which Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management compensates for those limitations, and the substantive reasons why Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide supplemental useful information to investors is included further below. This additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, gross profit, gross profit margin, operating profit (earnings from operations), operating profit margin (earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue), net earnings, diluted net earnings per share, and cash flow from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP.

In addition to the supplemental non-GAAP financial information, Hewlett Packard Enterprise also presents annualized revenue run-rate (“ARR”) as performance metric. ARR is a financial metric used to assess the growth of the Consumption Services offerings. ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income for operating leases and interest income from finance leases), and software-as-a-service (“SaaS”), software consumption revenue, and other as-a-service offerings, recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue and deferred revenue and are not intended to be combined with any of these items.

HPE shares Q2 numbers with details of how its as-a-service and hybrid cloud offerings sold by partners have fared
By
Simon Quicke, Microscope Editor
Published: 05 Jun 2024 15:15
GreenLake has continued to be an area of growth for HPE, with the as-a-service offering delivered via the channel attracting more customers during the vendor’s second quarter.


HPE shared results for Q2 with revenues improving by 3% coming in at $7.2bn, with annualised revenue run-rate improving by 37% to $1.5bn. 

In terms of technology segments, server revenues of $3.9bn up by 18% were the bright spot, with intelligent edge down by 19% to $1.1bn and hybrid cloud decreasing by 8% to $1.3bn.  

Specifically on the GreenLake front, HPE has been extending the portfolio, with increased networking support, and reported a decent performance in Q2. Earlier this year, HPE added more storage functionality to GreenLake, aimed at supporting more artificial intelligence (AI) features.

Speaking to analysts, HPE CEO Antonio Neri talked of the increased demand for GreenLake and its success getting the technology into fresh accounts.

“GreenLake hybrid cloud is attracting new customers,” he said. “In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the number of customer organisations using HPE GreenLake increased sequentially by almost 9% to 34,000.

“Our as-a-service lifetime total contract value grew to more than $15bn in Q2, with our annualised revenue run rate, or ARR, growing 39% year-over-year. Demand is increasing for our HPE GreenLake on-premise private cloud solutions.”

Customer demand
Looking ahead, the expectation is that AI will start to feature more in GreenLake and spur further demand from customers.

“Our AI orders, a healthy, intelligent edge, is set to grow sequentially beyond Q2 as expected, and AI emerged as a driver of a healthy HPE GreenLake momentum,” said Marie Myers, executive vice-president and chief financial officer at HPE. “We are seeing rapid growth in AI system revenue.

“GreenLake is a key differentiator,” she added. “We expect HPE GreenLake’s value proposition to key customers, including enterprises and sovereigns, to sharpen with the advent of AI.”

In general comments made about the Q2 numbers, Neri struck an upbeat tone, concentrating on the positives. “HPE delivered very solid results in Q2, exceeding revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance,” he said. “AI systems revenue more than doubled from the prior quarter, driven by our strong order book and better conversion from our supply chain.”

Echoing a theme that is resonating across the industry, HPE is looking to increased adoption of AI to contribute to revenues in the second half.

“Stronger AI systems order conversion, prudent cost discipline and higher-than-expected free cash flow drove a very solid performance in Q2,” said Myers. “Because of our robust AI systems, order momentum and disciplined execution across our entire portfolio, we are raising our revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year.

“We are driving profitable growth as we convert customer demand to revenue, particularly for HPE’s AI systems,” she added. “The long-term trends across hybrid cloud and networking also position us well for the future.”

Hewlett Packard Enterprise said Wednesday that it saw a pickup in artificial-intelligence demand for the latest quarter that helped push its revenue and other metrics above expectations.

Chief Financial Officer Marie Myers said HPE 
HPE

-1.52%
 posted a “quinfecta” for the fiscal third quarter, with revenue, earnings per share, cash and AI metrics all beating internal expectations, while the company also got the first $2.1 billion in cash from the partial sale of its H3C equity position.

The server maker and enterprise-technology company posted net earnings of $512 million, or 38 cents a share, compared with $464 million, or 36 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. On an adjusted basis, HPE logged earnings per share of 50 cents, above the 47-cent FactSet consensus view.

Revenue rose 10% to $7.7. billion, matching what analysts were expecting, though beating the $7.6 billion midpoint of the company’s forecast. AI-server revenue hit a new company record of about $1.3 billion, and HPE left the quarter with $3.4 billion in backlog.

“Our intention is to pursue profitable growth, and that’s the place we want to play,” Myers said. “Obviously, we have customers across the spectrum,” including “model builders, sovereigns and enterprise AI,” though she sees the company “particularly well-suited to enterprise AI.”

Myers also said that HPE has taken a disciplined approach to operating expenses.

Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani, though, flagged that HPE’s gross margins came in at 31.8%, down about 420 basis points relative to a year before.

That means the company “has not been insulated [from] gross-margin pressure [in] AI servers,” he wrote.

“While we expect gross margin pressures to persist, we think prudent [operating-expense] controls and re-accelerating networking growth in [fiscal 2025] could present some offsets,” Daryanani continued.

The stock fell about 2% in the extended session Wednesday.

The company’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenue outlook calls for $8.1 billion to $8.4 billion, while HPE also anticipates 52 cents to 57 cents in adjusted earnings per share for the period. Analysts were modeling $8.2 billion and 55 cents, respectively.

Myers sees opportunity when looking beyond this fiscal year as well.

“We’re taking orders across all the chips and we see no constraints on availability,” she said. “We believe that we have a very strong partnership with Nvidia, so we feel very well-positioned going forward.”

Despite these short-term challenges, Hewlett Packard Enterprise's long-term prospect seems bright as the company continues to gain customers for its products and solutions. For instance, HPE’s Aruba Networking recently upgraded advanced secure connectivity at Nobu Hotels’ select locations.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise equipped Nobu Hotels with its network infrastructure that is built on HPE Aruba and uses Zero Trust measures. It has installed artificial intelligence (AI)-based wired, wireless and SD-WAN solutions for Nobu Hotels to enhance guest experience and ensure constant connectivity and security.

The Aruba deployment will involve the setup of HPE Aruba Networking Central, HPE Aruba Networking ClearPass and HPE Aruba Networking User Experience Insight. These solutions will enhance the connectivity of mobile, IoT devices and AI-based applications. Accommodations, including door automation, security cameras, digital voice assistants, lighting, window blinds and in-room orders, will be installed. The solution will also be used to simplify the work of hospitality staff so they can focus better on customer service.

Aruba’s Robust Capabilities Aid HPE
The rising adoption of Aruba Networking by organizations worldwide can be credited to the ongoing enhancements that HPE is continuously making to improve the solution's capabilities.  So far this year, HPE added two new features to Aruba Networking.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise added GenAI LLM models in HPE Aruba Networking Central’s search feature to improve its accuracy. The company also launched HPE Aruba Networking Enterprise Private 5G, making HPE the world’s first company to provide Wi-Fi and private 5G solutions together.

Additionally, the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks JNPR is poised to strengthen HPE's networking portfolio, enabling the company to offer comprehensive solutions that integrate networking, security and cloud services.

These enhancements in Aruba Networking’s capabilities will help Hewlett Packard Enterprise in acquiring new clients. So far this year, the Aruba Networking solution has gained several clients for HPE, including Berger Paints, Nice Brazil, the city of Carmel, Royal Jaarbeurs, Houston Airports, Bethesda Health Group, University of Maryland and Dedini S/A Indústrias de Base.

With Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s blockbuster $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks on track to close later this year or early in 2025, the HPE Aruba networking business is recruiting data center and security partners.

“We are working closely with our distribution partners to try to recruit new partners especially in the security area and also around data center networking,” said HPE Aruba Worldwide Channel Chief Lene Skov in an interview with CRN.

The data center and security focus comes with Juniper poised to bring its robust position in the data center and security markets to HPE.

Skov, who is scheduled to address HPE Aurba partners at the first ever Aruba Atmosphere conference hosted at HPE Discover this week in Las Vegas, said she will emphasize the new total addressable market (TAM) opportunities available to partners.

“We want partners to understand there are growth possibilities expanding into the data center,” she said. “It is the growth possibilities around SD-WAN with or without security. That includes the SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) solution SSE (Security Service Edge). This is about making sure partners join us on that transformation journey focusing on capturing the new TAM.”

The data center and security networking drive comes with a “softness” in the classic wireless networking access points and switches, said Skov. “There is definitely opportunity in the new areas we have invested in,” she said. “It is about having that conversation with the partners about their transformation and expansion into new markets.”

Skov said there is a “huge” amount of enthusiasm among HPE Aruba and Juniper partners for the potential of the combination.

“I see a lot of our partners being very keen in understanding what will happen and absolutely also the other way around,” she said. “I also see partners already now planning for what they will do when they get access to one portfolio to the other portfolio.”

Skov said at this point she cannot advise partners on what will happen post-acquisition with the Aruba-Juniper integration. “There is a lot of excitement,” she said. “It is excitement about the strength of the new portfolio.”

Skov said she will also address at her Atmosphere keynote the ”large” AI opportunity for partners. “The AI opportunity is out there, it’s big, it’s a large opportunity, but there is still time,” she said.

Michael Vencel, president of Comport, one of HPE’s top enterprise partners, Ramsey, New Jersey, said Comport delivered 109 percent growth in 2023 on the Aruba product portfolio.

“Aruba is one of the fastest growing segments for us,” he said. “We are seeing customers that are deploying Aruba and moving from wireless to wired switching. That has really helped us grow the business.”

HPE Aruba’s broad and deep networking product portfolio along with a single management platform across the campus and data center environments is resonating with customers, said Vencel.

“Many customers are working on multiple legacy networking platforms and tools,” he said. “We see that in a lot of different industries. There is absolutely a desire among customers to streamline the number of OEMs they do business with and simplify.”

As for the security market opportunity, Vencel said that it remains “absolutely the number one topic” for customers. That has led to triple-digit sales growth in Comport’s ComportSecure service provider offering, said Vencel.

“We see very few of our competitors that have that capability,: he said. “What we are trying to achieve with ComportSecure is give our customers choices. It is a fully managed solution delivered to them in a flexible consumption model.”",https://www.crn.com/news/networking/2024/hpe-aruba-is-recruiting-networking-data-center-and-security-partners-ahead-of-hpe-s-14b-acquisition-of-juniper-networks
HPE’s Aruba doubles down on AI and edge networking at Discover 2021,22-Jun-21,"HPE’s Aruba doubles down on AI and edge networking at Discover 2021

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.’s Aruba networking division debuted new artificial intelligence features at the HPE Discover 2021 virtual event today that can automatically fix certain types of technical issues in corporate networks. 

Also at the event, Aruba said that it’s rolling out a family of ruggedized switches capable of operating in edge computing environments with “extreme” temperatures.

Aruba, officially Aruba Networks, makes networking equipment that companies use to provide Wi-Fi coverage at their corporate locations and connect those locations with remote infrastructure such as public cloud environments. Aruba also provides a cloud-based management platform called Aruba Central for managing deployments of its hardware. 

Aruba Central is receiving a new set of so-called AIOps features as part of the updates announced today that can automatically fix technical problems in a company’s network. The features are built on Edge Services Platform, a technology introduced last year that uses machine learning to find technical problems, understand what caused them and  provide remediation suggestions. Aruba Central’s new AIOps features use the suggestions generated by the Edge Services Platform to determine how to go about fixing an issue.

The Edge Services Platform generates troubleshooting tips by analyzing over 1.5 billion data points a day from the roughly 1 million Aruba network devices running in customer environments worldwide. It aggregates the data points in a centralized cloud repository, where machine learning algorithms analyze them to understand how a network device behaves when everything is running smoothly. If a device displays anomalous behavior, the machine learning algorithms infer that there may be a technical issue.

Aruba says Aruba Central can use the technology to address technical issues stemming  from internal network problems, such as if bandwidth demand at an office exceeds the capacity of the onsite switch. The software is also capable of diagnosing disruptions caused by external sources.

Wi-Fi networks at retail locations, for example, sometimes experience performance drops when there’s a lot of foot traffic in front of a store because of network interference from pedestrians’ smartphones. Aruba Central can spot such interference and show administrators what network settings they should change to fix the issue. 



The other set of updates Aruba announced at HPE Discover 2021 focus on edge environments and the connected devices deployed at those environments. 

In addition to its AI features, Aruba Central provides a monitoring console for tracking the health of a company’s network equipment. Aruba Central’s monitoring features are being expanded with a new tool called IoT Operations that will enable administrators to also track sensors and “internet of things” devices at the edge of the network. If necessary, companies can extend IoT Operations’ default feature set by downloading add-ons from Aruba software partners.

The adds are available via a new built-in app store that is rolling out as part of the same update.

In conjunction, the HPE unit is expanding its hardware lineup with a set of new switches for edge locations. The first addition is the Aruba CX 4100i series, a family of switches with ruggedized cases (below) that Aruba says are “designed to withstand extreme temperatures and harsh environments” such as industrial sites. The second addition to the HPE unit’s hardware portfolio is the Aruba CX 6000, an entry-level switch for less demanding edge locations such as branch offices.



Capping off Aruba’s product updates from Discover 2021 is a set of security controls in Aruba Central for regulating user access to the corporate network. The new controls allow companies to require that a device meet certain cybersecurity requirements before it’s allowed to log into the network.

The new features advance a years-long effort by Aruba to take on a bigger role in its enterprise customers’ networks. Aruba, which became part of HPE through a $3 billion acquisition in 2015, initially provided products mainly for building local networks at locations such as offices. In 2018, it moved into the SD-WAN market by launching a set of products that allow companies to link together their data centers and other corporate locations via long-range connections. Aruba has since introduced features for managing connections to public clouds such as Amazon Web Services.

With today’s updates, Aruba is expanding its feature set to yet more parts of the corporate network. The ruggedized Aruba CX 4100i switches put the HPE unit in a better position to target industrial edge computing locations, while the new IoT Operations tool extends Aruba Central’s target use cases to include connected device management.

Aruba’s product strategy is helping to lift parent HPE’s revenues. HPE’s most recent earnings report revealed that its Intelligence Edge business, which includes Aruba Central as well as its switching products, saw revenues jump 20% to $799 million in the second quarter. The company disclosed that sales of Aruba Central rose in triple-digits from a year earlier and, without sharing specific numbers, said the platform is “now a meaningful contributor to HPE’s overall ARR.”",https://siliconangle.com/2021/06/22/hpes-aruba-doubles-ai-edge-networking-discover-2021/
