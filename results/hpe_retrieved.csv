Hewlett Packard Enterprise has filed with the European Commission for regulatory approval of its blockbuster $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks. European regulators now have until August to either approve HPEs deal or force deeper investigations that could potentially stall the merger.

The European Commission now has a deadline of Aug. 1 to either approve the HPE-Juniper merger or open a full-scale investigation into the deal.

Additionally, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) recently started a preliminary investigation into the potential impacts of the massive tech merger.

The CMA has set a deadline of Aug. 14 to decide whether to approve the deal or progress the investigation to a formal phase 2 inquiry that would spawn a deeper investigation.

The CMA is considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002, said U.K. Competition and Markets Authority in a statement. And, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.

This all means HPEs $14 billion deal for Juniper Networks could potentially receive the green light in Europe by mid-August.

When Will The HPE-Juniper Acquisition Officially Close?

The merger has been approved by both HPE and Juniper board of directors as well as shareholders.

Importantly, it is unlikely that the deal will need Chinas approval as it falls below the Chinese merger threshold. But the U.S. Federal Trade Commission will still likely scrutinize the merger.

Regardless of all the regulatory hurdles, HPE says it expects to acquire Juniper Networks in late 2024 or early 2025.

We can confirm the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority has accepted our filing, as part of the standard process to review the proposed acquisition of Juniper Networks in several jurisdictions, said HPE in a statement to CRN. We are working to complete all necessary reviews and secure clearance quickly and efficiently so that we can begin delivering value to our customers as soon as possible. We continue to expect to close by the end of calendar year 2024 or early 2025.

This still fits within HPEs initial timeframe of closing the deal by as late as early 2025, roughly one year after announcing the deal.

HPEs $14 Billion Plan For Juniper

In January, HPE unveiled its plan to buy networking superstar Juniper Networks for $14 billion.

The merger is expected to achieve joint operating efficiencies and cost synergies of $450 million per year.

The combination of the two tech giants could establish a new battleground in the networking space as well as in AI. Juniper Networks CEO Rami Rahim, if the deal is completed, will lead the combined HPE networking business, which includes HPEs Aruba business. Rahim will report directly to HPE CEO Antonio Neri.

In a recent interview with CRN, Rahim said AI is going to be as big, if not bigger than any technology trend in history.

The kind of moves that are necessary to capture this [AI] opportunity are the big bold moves, he said.

This combination with HPE is exactly that. It gives us an ability to accelerate our innovation across the entire networking stack. In fact, not even the networking stack, but the entire IT stack, compute, storage, networking, silicon systems and software, in all of the relevant networking domains for our customers; campus, branch, data center, wide area networks, and to all of the different customer verticals, certainly enterprise, but also cloud and service providers, as well, Rahim told CRN. Together with HPE, we can build truly comprehensive, competitive, end-to-end experience-first networking solutions that are going to make a big difference for our customers and our partners.",What is the impact of the HPE-Juniper Networks $14B merger on HPE's stock price?

Key Takeaways
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported fiscal third-quarter sales that beat analysts' expectations, buoyed by a surge in server revenue driven by artificial intelligence demand.

Diluted earnings per share missed estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, though adjusted earnings came ahead of projections.

The company raised and narrowed its outlook for full-year earnings.





Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) posted fiscal third-quarter sales that beat analysts' expectations, buoyed by a surge in server revenue driven by demand for artificial intelligence (AI).

The server and storage maker reported third-quarter revenue jumped 10% year-over-year to $7.7 billion, above analysts expectations. Server revenue was up 35% from the year-ago quarter to $4.3 billion. Revenue from HP Enterprise's Intelligent Edge and cloud segments fell year-over-year, while revenue in its financial services segment rose 1%.

Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 38 cents missed analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, though adjusted EPS of 50 cents came ahead of projections.

These results reflect our momentum in delivering on our edge-to-cloud strategy across networking, hybrid cloud, and AI,"" HP Enterprise CEO Antonio Neri said in a release.

The company raised its full-year EPS outlook to between $1.68 and $1.73, up from $1.61 to $1.71 previously, and maintained its revenue growth estimate of 1% to 3%.

HP Enterprise shares were down about 1.9% at $18.42 in extended trading Wednesday following the company's earnings release.

(Bloomberg) -- Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. reported weaker-than-expected margins, suggesting lower profitability than anticipated in its closely watched business of selling servers for artificial intelligence work.

Fiscal third-quarter adjusted gross margins were 31.8%, a decline from the period a year ago, the company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated 33.4%. The decline was driven by a higher mix of AI server revenue, Chief Financial Officer Marie Myers said on a call with analysts after the results were released.

Hardware makers including HPE, Dell Technologies Inc. and Super Micro Computer Inc. have enjoyed a jump in customer demand for high-powered servers to handle AI tasks. HPE reported $1.3 billion in revenue from this business line in the quarter that ended July 31, a 39% increase from the previous period and higher than analysts average estimate.

Investors have become increasingly concerned about the lower margins of most AI servers, owing to the expensive semiconductors they contain made by companies such as Nvidia Corp. In an interview, Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri said that over time HPE will sell more higher-margin products and services along with the AI servers.

The shares declined about 3% in extended trading after closing at $18.77 in New York. The stock has gained 11% this year through the close.

Weak AI-server margin has been a theme for the sector, tripping up Super Micro and Dell over the past couple of quarters, Woo Jin Ho, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a note. HPEs soft margins may overshadow its healthy AI sales momentum, he added.


The majority of HPEs AI server business continues to come from cloud service providers, but there is increasing momentum with enterprises and governments, Neri said.

HPE reported that total revenue increased 10% to $7.71 billion in the period, compared with the $7.66 billion average estimate. Its the biggest year-over-year sales increase in six quarters. Profit, excluding some items, was 50 cents a share. Analysts, on average, projected 47 cents.

In the quarter ending in October, HPE projected sales of $8.1 billion to $8.4 billion. Profit, excluding some items, will be 52 cents a share to 57 cents a share. Analysts, on average, estimated profit of 54 cents on revenue of $8.15 billion.

HPE said it received about $2.1 billion from the partial sale of its stake in H3C Technologies Co. The financial impact of that transaction will be reflected in the current quarters results, the company said.

WHR
+0.67%
In the latest trading session, Whirlpool (WHR) closed at $98.83, marking a +0.67% move from the previous day. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.16%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.09%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.3%.

Shares of the maker of Maytag, KitchenAid and other appliances witnessed a gain of 6.29% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Consumer Discretionary sector with its gain of 5.25% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.64%.


The upcoming earnings release of Whirlpool will be of great interest to investors. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $3.04, showcasing a 44.22% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $4.07 billion, indicating a 17.29% decrease compared to the same quarter of the previous year.

WHR's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $11.31 per share and revenue of $16.78 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -30.01% and -13.73%, respectively.

Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Whirlpool. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.

Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.

The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Whirlpool presently features a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).

In terms of valuation, Whirlpool is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 8.68. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 13.32, so one might conclude that Whirlpool is trading at a discount comparatively.

The Household Appliances industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 194, positioning it in the bottom 24% of all 250+ industries.

The Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

-1.52%
JNPR
+0.03%
Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE shares have returned 12.8% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industrys growth of 16.2%. Macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical issues have kept the broader stock market highly volatile this year so far, and HPE stock has not been spared.

Despite these short-term challenges, Hewlett Packard Enterprise's long-term prospect seems bright as the company continues to gain customers for its products and solutions. For instance, HPEs Aruba Networking recently upgraded advanced secure connectivity at Nobu Hotels select locations.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise equipped Nobu Hotels with its network infrastructure that is built on HPE Aruba and uses Zero Trust measures. It has installed artificial intelligence (AI)-based wired, wireless and SD-WAN solutions for Nobu Hotels to enhance guest experience and ensure constant connectivity and security.

The Aruba deployment will involve the setup of HPE Aruba Networking Central, HPE Aruba Networking ClearPass and HPE Aruba Networking User Experience Insight. These solutions will enhance the connectivity of mobile, IoT devices and AI-based applications. Accommodations, including door automation, security cameras, digital voice assistants, lighting, window blinds and in-room orders, will be installed. The solution will also be used to simplify the work of hospitality staff so they can focus better on customer service.

Arubas Robust Capabilities Aid HPE
The rising adoption of Aruba Networking by organizations worldwide can be credited to the ongoing enhancements that HPE is continuously making to improve the solution's capabilities.  So far this year, HPE added two new features to Aruba Networking.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise added GenAI LLM models in HPE Aruba Networking Centrals search feature to improve its accuracy. The company also launched HPE Aruba Networking Enterprise Private 5G, making HPE the worlds first company to provide Wi-Fi and private 5G solutions together.

Additionally, the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks JNPR is poised to strengthen HPE's networking portfolio, enabling the company to offer comprehensive solutions that integrate networking, security and cloud services.

These enhancements in Aruba Networkings capabilities will help Hewlett Packard Enterprise in acquiring new clients. So far this year, the Aruba Networking solution has gained several clients for HPE, including Berger Paints, Nice Brazil, the city of Carmel, Royal Jaarbeurs, Houston Airports, Bethesda Health Group, University of Maryland and Dedini S/A Indústrias de Base.

H3C Technologies Co., Limited Update

HPE also notes that on September 4, 2024, the company received proceeds of approximately $2.1 billion from the partial sale of its equity position in H3C Technologies Co., Limited (representing 30% of all H3C shares) from Unisplendour International Technology Limited.

2 Annualized Revenue Run-Rate (ARR) is a financial metric used to assess the growth of the Consumption Services offerings. ARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income from finance leases), and software-as-a-Service, software consumption revenue, and other as-a-Service offerings, recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. We use ARR as a performance metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with it.

3 Free cash flow represents cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures (investments in property, plant & equipment (PP&E) and software assets less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.?

5 Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides certain guidance on a non-GAAP basis. In reliance on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is unable to provide a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts, as the Company cannot predict some elements that are included in such directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These elements could have a material impact on the Companys reported GAAP results for the guidance period. Refer to the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures below for more information.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise also provides forecasts of revenue growth on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, non-GAAP operating profit growth, and FCF. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures for this quarter and prior periods are included in the tables below or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release. In addition an explanation of the ways in which Hewlett Packard Enterprises management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its business, the substance behind Hewlett Packard Enterprises decision to use these non-GAAP measures, the material limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures, the manner in which Hewlett Packard Enterprises management compensates for those limitations, and the substantive reasons why Hewlett Packard Enterprises management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide supplemental useful information to investors is included further below.

In addition to the supplemental non-GAAP financial information, Hewlett Packard Enterprise also presents annualized revenue run-rate (ARR) as performance metric.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with HPE.


On February 29, 2024, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) released its 8-K filing, detailing the financial outcomes for the first quarter ended January 31, 2024. HPE, a global edge-to-cloud company, reported a mixed financial performance, with a notable decline in revenue but an increase in profitability and annualized revenue run-rate (ARR).

HPE's revenue for the quarter stood at $6.8 billion, reflecting a 14% decrease from the same period last year. This decline was consistent in both actual dollars and constant currency. However, the company's ARR experienced a robust 42% year-over-year growth, reaching $1.4 billion. This growth in ARR underscores HPE's successful strategic pivot towards a recurring revenue model, which is increasingly important in the technology sector where predictable and stable revenue streams are highly valued.

The company's gross margins improved significantly, with GAAP gross profit margin increasing by 240 basis points to 36.4% compared to the prior-year period. This improvement in profitability is indicative of HPE's operational efficiency and its ability to manage costs effectively, even in a challenging market environment.

Despite the revenue decline, HPE's diluted net earnings per share (EPS) on a GAAP basis was $0.29, a 24% decrease from the prior-year period but still above the midpoint of the guidance range. This performance suggests that while top-line growth was pressured, bottom-line results benefited from the company's focus on profitability.

Free cash flow (FCF) for the quarter was negative at $(482) million, yet it showed an improvement of $844 million from the prior-year period. The negative FCF highlights the investment phase of the company's transformation, but the year-over-year improvement signals progress towards generating positive cash flows in the future.

Revenue from HP Enterprise's Intelligent Edge and cloud segments fell year-over-year, while revenue in its financial services segment rose 1%.

Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 38 cents missed analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, though adjusted EPS of 50 cents came ahead of projections.

These results reflect our momentum in delivering on our edge-to-cloud strategy across networking, hybrid cloud, and AI,"" HP Enterprise CEO Antonio Neri said in a release.

The company raised its full-year EPS outlook to between $1.68 and $1.73, up from $1.61 to $1.71 previously, and maintained its revenue growth estimate of 1% to 3%.

HP Enterprise shares were down about 1.9% at $18.42 in extended trading Wednesday following the company's earnings release.

HPE
-1.52%
(Bloomberg) -- Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. reported weaker-than-expected margins, suggesting lower profitability than anticipated in its closely watched business of selling servers for artificial intelligence work.

Fiscal third-quarter adjusted gross margins were 31.8%, a decline from the period a year ago, the company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated 33.4%. The decline was driven by a higher mix of AI server revenue, Chief Financial Officer Marie Myers said on a call with analysts after the results were released.

Hardware makers including HPE, Dell Technologies Inc. and Super Micro Computer Inc. have enjoyed a jump in customer demand for high-powered servers to handle AI tasks. HPE reported $1.3 billion in revenue from this business line in the quarter that ended July 31, a 39% increase from the previous period and higher than analysts average estimate.

Investors have become increasingly concerned about the lower margins of most AI servers, owing to the expensive semiconductors they contain made by companies such as Nvidia Corp. In an interview, Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri said that over time HPE will sell more higher-margin products and services along with the AI servers.

The shares declined about 3% in extended trading after closing at $18.77 in New York. The stock has gained 11% this year through the close.

Weak AI-server margin has been a theme for the sector, tripping up Super Micro and Dell over the past couple of quarters, Woo Jin Ho, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a note. HPEs soft margins may overshadow its healthy AI sales momentum, he added.


The majority of HPEs AI server business continues to come from cloud service providers, but there is increasing momentum with enterprises and governments, Neri said.

HPE reported that total revenue increased 10% to $7.71 billion in the period, compared with the $7.66 billion average estimate. Its the biggest year-over-year sales increase in six quarters. Profit, excluding some items, was 50 cents a share. Analysts, on average, projected 47 cents.

In the quarter ending in October, HPE projected sales of $8.1 billion to $8.4 billion. Profit, excluding some items, will be 52 cents a share to 57 cents a share. Analysts, on average, estimated profit of 54 cents on revenue of $8.15 billion.

HPE said it received about $2.1 billion from the partial sale of its stake in H3C Technologies Co. The financial impact of that transaction will be reflected in the current quarters results, the company said.

10,"HPE-Juniper Networks $14B Merger: EU To Make Key Decisions By August
By Mark Haranas
July 8, 2024, 12:08 PM EDT
HPE has filed with the European regulatory commissions for approval to purchase Juniper Networks. Heres the timeline for the blockbuster $14 billion merger.



Listen to this article
4 min
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has filed with the European Commission for regulatory approval of its blockbuster $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks. European regulators now have until August to either approve HPEs deal or force deeper investigations that could potentially stall the merger.

The European Commission now has a deadline of Aug. 1 to either approve the HPE-Juniper merger or open a full-scale investigation into the deal.

Additionally, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) recently started a preliminary investigation into the potential impacts of the massive tech merger.

The CMA has set a deadline of Aug. 14 to decide whether to approve the deal or progress the investigation to a formal phase 2 inquiry that would spawn a deeper investigation.

The CMA is considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002, said U.K. Competition and Markets Authority in a statement. And, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.

This all means HPEs $14 billion deal for Juniper Networks could potentially receive the green light in Europe by mid-August.

When Will The HPE-Juniper Acquisition Officially Close?

The merger has been approved by both HPE and Juniper board of directors as well as shareholders.

Importantly, it is unlikely that the deal will need Chinas approval as it falls below the Chinese merger threshold. But the U.S. Federal Trade Commission will still likely scrutinize the merger.

Regardless of all the regulatory hurdles, HPE says it expects to acquire Juniper Networks in late 2024 or early 2025.

We can confirm the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority has accepted our filing, as part of the standard process to review the proposed acquisition of Juniper Networks in several jurisdictions, said HPE in a statement to CRN. We are working to complete all necessary reviews and secure clearance quickly and efficiently so that we can begin delivering value to our customers as soon as possible. We continue to expect to close by the end of calendar year 2024 or early 2025.

This still fits within HPEs initial timeframe of closing the deal by as late as early 2025, roughly one year after announcing the deal.

HPEs $14 Billion Plan For Juniper

In January, HPE unveiled its plan to buy networking superstar Juniper Networks for $14 billion.

The merger is expected to achieve joint operating efficiencies and cost synergies of $450 million per year.

The combination of the two tech giants could establish a new battleground in the networking space as well as in AI. Juniper Networks CEO Rami Rahim, if the deal is completed, will lead the combined HPE networking business, which includes HPEs Aruba business. Rahim will report directly to HPE CEO Antonio Neri.

In a recent interview with CRN, Rahim said AI is going to be as big, if not bigger than any technology trend in history.

The kind of moves that are necessary to capture this [AI] opportunity are the big bold moves, he said.

This combination with HPE is exactly that. It gives us an ability to accelerate our innovation across the entire networking stack. In fact, not even the networking stack, but the entire IT stack, compute, storage, networking, silicon systems and software, in all of the relevant networking domains for our customers; campus, branch, data center, wide area networks, and to all of the different customer verticals, certainly enterprise, but also cloud and service providers, as well, Rahim told CRN. Together with HPE, we can build truly comprehensive, competitive, end-to-end experience-first networking solutions that are going to make a big difference for our customers and our partners.",How might regulatory actions from the EU influence HPE's business decisions?

-1.52%
JNPR
+0.03%
Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE shares have returned 12.8% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industrys growth of 16.2%. Macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical issues have kept the broader stock market highly volatile this year so far, and HPE stock has not been spared.

Despite these short-term challenges, Hewlett Packard Enterprise's long-term prospect seems bright as the company continues to gain customers for its products and solutions. For instance, HPEs Aruba Networking recently upgraded advanced secure connectivity at Nobu Hotels select locations.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise equipped Nobu Hotels with its network infrastructure that is built on HPE Aruba and uses Zero Trust measures. It has installed artificial intelligence (AI)-based wired, wireless and SD-WAN solutions for Nobu Hotels to enhance guest experience and ensure constant connectivity and security.

The Aruba deployment will involve the setup of HPE Aruba Networking Central, HPE Aruba Networking ClearPass and HPE Aruba Networking User Experience Insight. These solutions will enhance the connectivity of mobile, IoT devices and AI-based applications. Accommodations, including door automation, security cameras, digital voice assistants, lighting, window blinds and in-room orders, will be installed. The solution will also be used to simplify the work of hospitality staff so they can focus better on customer service.

Arubas Robust Capabilities Aid HPE
The rising adoption of Aruba Networking by organizations worldwide can be credited to the ongoing enhancements that HPE is continuously making to improve the solution's capabilities.  So far this year, HPE added two new features to Aruba Networking.


Hewlett Packard Enterprise added GenAI LLM models in HPE Aruba Networking Centrals search feature to improve its accuracy. The company also launched HPE Aruba Networking Enterprise Private 5G, making HPE the worlds first company to provide Wi-Fi and private 5G solutions together.

Additionally, the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks JNPR is poised to strengthen HPE's networking portfolio, enabling the company to offer comprehensive solutions that integrate networking, security and cloud services.

These enhancements in Aruba Networkings capabilities will help Hewlett Packard Enterprise in acquiring new clients. So far this year, the Aruba Networking solution has gained several clients for HPE, including Berger Paints, Nice Brazil, the city of Carmel, Royal Jaarbeurs, Houston Airports, Bethesda Health Group, University of Maryland and Dedini S/A Indústrias de Base.
