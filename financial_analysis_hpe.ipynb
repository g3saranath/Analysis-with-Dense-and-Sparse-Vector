       "  'HPE-Juniper Networks $14B Merger: EU To Make Key Decisions By August\\nBy Mark Haranas\\nJuly 8, 2024, 12:08 PM EDT\\nHPE has filed with the European regulatory commissions for approval to purchase Juniper Networks. Here\\x92s the timeline for the blockbuster $14 billion merger.\\n\\n\\n\\nListen to this article\\n4 min\\nHewlett Packard Enterprise has filed with the European Commission for regulatory approval of its blockbuster $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks. European regulators now have until August to either approve HPE\\x92s deal or force deeper investigations that could potentially stall the merger.\\n\\nThe European Commission now has a deadline of Aug. 1 to either approve the HPE-Juniper merger or open a full-scale investigation into the deal.\\n\\nAdditionally, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) recently started a preliminary investigation into the potential impacts of the massive tech merger.\\n\\nThe CMA has set a deadline of Aug. 14 to decide whether to approve the deal or progress the investigation to a formal \\x93phase 2\\x94 inquiry that would spawn a deeper investigation.\\n\\n[Related: The 10 Hottest Cloud Computing Startups Of 2024 (So Far)]\\n\\n\\x93The CMA is considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002,\\x94 said U.K. Competition and Markets Authority in a statement. \\x93And, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.\\x94\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nThis all means HPE\\x92s $14 billion deal for Juniper Networks could potentially receive the green light in Europe by mid-August.\\n\\nWhen Will The HPE-Juniper Acquisition Officially Close?\\n\\nThe merger has been approved by both HPE and Juniper board of directors as well as shareholders.\\n\\nImportantly, it is unlikely that the deal will need China\\x92s approval as it falls below the Chinese merger threshold. But the U.S. Federal Trade Commission will still likely scrutinize the merger.\\n\\nRegardless of all the regulatory hurdles, HPE says it expects to acquire Juniper Networks in late 2024 or early 2025.\\n\\n\\x93We can confirm the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority has accepted our filing, as part of the standard process to review the proposed acquisition of Juniper Networks in several jurisdictions,\\x94 said HPE in a statement to CRN. \\x93We are working to complete all necessary reviews and secure clearance quickly and efficiently so that we can begin delivering value to our customers as soon as possible. We continue to expect to close by the end of calendar year 2024 or early 2025.\\x94\\n\\nThis still fits within HPE\\x92s initial timeframe of closing the deal by as late as early 2025, roughly one year after announcing the deal.\\n\\nHPE\\x92s $14 Billion Plan For Juniper\\n\\nIn January, HPE unveiled its plan to buy networking superstar Juniper Networks for $14 billion.\\n\\nThe merger is expected to achieve joint operating efficiencies and cost synergies of $450 million per year.\\n\\nThe combination of the two tech giants could establish a new battleground in the networking space as well as in AI. Juniper Networks CEO Rami Rahim, if the deal is completed, will lead the combined HPE networking business, which includes HPE\\x92s Aruba business. Rahim will report directly to HPE CEO Antonio Neri.\\n\\nIn a recent interview with CRN, Rahim said AI is going \\x93to be as big, if not bigger\\x94 than any technology trend in history.\\n\\n\\x93The kind of moves that are necessary to capture this [AI] opportunity are the big bold moves,\\x94 he said.\\n\\n\\x93This combination with HPE is exactly that. It gives us an ability to accelerate our innovation across the entire networking stack. In fact, not even the networking stack, but the entire IT stack, compute, storage, networking, silicon systems and software, in all of the relevant networking domains for our customers; campus, branch, data center, wide area networks, and to all of the different customer verticals, certainly enterprise, but also cloud and service providers, as well,\\x94 Rahim told CRN. \\x93Together with HPE, we can build truly comprehensive, competitive, end-to-end experience-first networking solutions that are going to make a big difference for our customers and our partners.\\x94',\n",

Macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical issues have kept the broader stock market highly volatile this year so far, and HPE stock has not been spared.\\n\\nDespite these short-term challenges, Hewlett Packard Enterprise's long-term prospect seems bright as the company continues to gain customers for its products and solutions. For instance, HPE\\x92s Aruba Networking recently upgraded advanced secure connectivity at Nobu Hotels\\x92 select locations.\\n\\n\\nHewlett Packard Enterprise equipped Nobu Hotels with its network infrastructure that is built on HPE Aruba and uses Zero Trust measures. It has installed artificial intelligence (AI)-based wired, wireless and SD-WAN solutions for Nobu Hotels to enhance guest experience and ensure constant connectivity and security.\\n\\nThe Aruba deployment will involve the setup of HPE Aruba Networking Central, HPE Aruba Networking ClearPass and HPE Aruba Networking User Experience Insight. These solutions will enhance the connectivity of mobile, IoT devices and AI-based applications. Accommodations, including door automation, security cameras, digital voice assistants, lighting, window blinds and in-room orders, will be installed.

So far this year, HPE added two new features to Aruba Networking.\\n\\n\\nHewlett Packard Enterprise added GenAI LLM models in HPE Aruba Networking Central\\x92s search feature to improve its accuracy. The company also launched HPE Aruba Networking Enterprise Private 5G, making HPE the world\\x92s first company to provide Wi-Fi and private 5G solutions together.\\n\\nAdditionally, the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks JNPR is poised to strengthen HPE's networking portfolio, enabling the company to offer comprehensive solutions that integrate networking, security and cloud services.\\n\\nThese enhancements in Aruba Networking\\x92s capabilities will help Hewlett Packard Enterprise in acquiring new clients. So far this year, the Aruba Networking solution has gained several clients for HPE, including Berger Paints, Nice Brazil, the city of Carmel, Royal Jaarbeurs, Houston Airports, Bethesda Health Group, University of Maryland and Dedini S/A Indústrias de Base.\\n\\n\"],\n",
