Apple reported $7.78 billion in Mac revenue during its fiscal first-quarter earnings report, which showed less than 1% growth. The latest computers may help boost the company\\'s sales.\\n\\nApple said its new MacBook Air laptops offer sharper 1080p webcams, support for faster Wi-Fi networks and up to 18 hours of battery life. The design remains the same as earlier models. The new M3 chip allows users to add up to two external displays, an improvement from a single screen supported by earlier chips. The lid of the laptop has to remain closed to support two screens, otherwise just one will work.\\n\\nApple\\'s announcement showed it\\'s stepping up its marketing around artificial intelligence.\\n\\nIt called the new MacBook Air the \"world\\'s best consumer laptop for AI.\" It\\'s an interesting change of language since Apple didn\\'t mention that when it introduced the iMac with M3 in October, but shows it\\'s trying to compete with new Windows laptops billed as \"AI PCs.\"\\n\\nStill, the most popular AI platforms, such as OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT, Anthropic\\'s Claude and others, run in the cloud over an internet connection, not directly on a computer. Apps such as Pixelmator Pro can use AI to remove background noise in photos, Apple said, although that\\'s more in line with how apps have used artificial intelligence for years.\\n\\nApple CEO Tim Cook reiterated on Feb. 28 that Apple is \"investing significantly\" in artificial intelligence and teased a major announcement later this year. That may come during Apple\\'s Worldwide Developer Conference in June, when the company typically unveils new software. It\\'s possible Apple announces its own large language model that could run locally on its Macs and other devices, such as iPhones and iPads.\\n\\nThe 13-inch MacBook Air starts at $1,099, while the 15-inch starts at $1,299.

       " {'document': 'Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrates an Oculus Rift virtual reality (VR) headset and Oculus Touch controllers during the Oculus Connect 3 event in San Jose, California, U.S., on Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016.\\n\\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared his opinion of Apple \\'s new mixed-reality headset, the Vision Pro, in a video posted to Instagram where he called Meta\\'s Quest 3 headset \"the better value\" and \"the better product, period.\"\\n\\nWhile it\\'s obvious Zuckerberg would promote his company\\'s product, his decision to post a video about the differences between the Quest 3 and Vision Pro shows the increasing competition between Apple and Meta. Both companies are trying to sell consumers on the benefit of mixed-reality headsets that overlay digital content over the real world or provide immersive virtual reality experiences. Meta has taken a lower-cost approach while Apple has focused on sharper screens, more powerful processors and higher-end materials.\\n\\nZuckerberg, in the video posted Tuesday, said he thinks the Quest headset is \"a lot more comfortable,\" its immersive content library is deeper, its field of view is wider, its hand tracking is more accurate and its screen is brighter compared with the Vision Pro. However, he noted that Apple\\'s screen has a higher resolution and that its eye tracking is \"really nice.\"\\n\\n\"It seems like there are a lot of people who just assumed that Vision Pro would be higher quality because it\\'s Apple and it costs $3,000 more, but honestly, I\\'m pretty surprised that Quest is so much better for the vast majority of things that people use these headsets for, with that price differential,\" Zuckerberg said.\\n\\nApple officially launched its Vision Pro in the U.S. on Feb 2. The $3,500 headset is the first new product category the company has released since the Apple Watch in 2015. At an event to celebrate the launch in New York, Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC\\'s Jim Cramer that the headset is \"tomorrow\\'s technology today.\"\\n\\nMeta introduced its Quest 3 headset in September, and the devices started shipping the following month. The Quest 3 starts at $500, which is $200 more expensive than Meta\\'s previous headset. The defining feature of Meta\\'s new headset is its \"passthrough\" mode, which is the ability to quickly see the world outside the headset. Apple\\'s headset offers similar functionality.\\n\\nIn the video, Zuckerberg said he knows some \"fanboys\" get upset when people question whether Apple will dominate in a new category, but he said he thinks Meta\\'s open model for its headsets will win.\\n\\n\"The future is not yet written,\" he said.\\n\\nApple did not immediately respond to CNBC\\'s request for comment.\\n\\nDon\\'t miss these stories from CNBC PRO:'},\n",
       " {'document': 'The logos of Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft displayed on a mobile phone with an EU flag pictured in the background. Justin Tallis | AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nAn EU law that seeks to rein in large digital companies has officially kicked in, spelling big changes for primarily U.S. tech giants. The European Union\\'s landmark Digital Markets Act officially became enforceable on Thursday. That means the European Commission, the EU executive arm, can start taking action against companies that breach the rules. The Digital Markets Act aims to clamp down on anti-competitive practices from tech players, as well as force them to open out some of their services to other competitors. Smaller internet firms and other businesses have complained about being hurt by the practices of these companies. Bill Echikson, a non-resident senior follow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), said that the EU reforms mean that technology giants will graduate from \"teenagers\" to \"grown-ups\" now. \"There\\'s a lot of changes that could or could not happen. A lot of it is uncertain,\" Echikson said. But, he added, the new law could inspire change in other countries, like the U.S. and the U.K. and ultimately force tech firms into global tweaks to their platforms. CNBC runs through how the law impacts large U.S. tech companies — as well as consumers in the EU.\\n\\nWhat does it mean for Big Tech?\\n\\nThe EU Digital Markets Act primarily impacts U.S. tech giants — the likes of Alphabet , Amazon , Apple , and Meta . That\\'s because the rules impose strict curbs for so-called \"gatekeepers\" — firms with an entrenched position in their respective market, with a market capitalization of at least 75 billion euros ($81.7 billion) and with a platform with 45 million monthly active end users in the EU. That makes U.S. tech giants a key target. So far, six firms have been designated gatekeepers: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and China\\'s ByteDance — the sole non-U.S. firm on the list. These companies are required to adjust their platforms to make competition healthier in the bloc. For example, they must ensure they\\'re not giving their services preference over rivals on their own platforms. Google, for instance, can\\'t force users to select its own search engine on Android phones when they set up their devices and must show alternatives, like DuckDuckGo, or Ecosia.\\n\\nSome messaging apps, like Facebook Messenger, must also make their services \"interoperable\" with third-party messaging services, so that users can message people using alternative products. Companies with entrenched positions in app distribution must meanwhile also allow competing apps to appear on their platforms. Apple has been ordered under the DMA to allow alternative app stores on iPhones for the first time. The tech giant was this week slapped by the EU with a fine of more than 1.8 billion euro ($1.96 billion) for breaching competition rules, following an investigation into its App Store practices. The EU thinks Apple broke the law by preventing app developers from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app. Spotify praised the Commission\\'s decision, while Apple denied its App Store violates the law. The fine could be a sign of what\\'s to come, as DMA enforcement officially gets underway. Companies in persistent breach of the law can face fines as large as 10% of their global annual revenues.\\n\\nHow are EU citizens affected?\\n\\nThe rules have already sparked big changes for tech giants in how they serve customers in the EU. It\\'s likely more adjustments will come, as competitors to Big Tech firms aren\\'t happy with the proposals put in place so far. Apple recently announced it would open up its iPhone and iPad to alternative app stores. Developers have long complained about the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.\\n\\nwatch now'}]"
